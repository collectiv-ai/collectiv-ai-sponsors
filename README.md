## 🌍 What is CollectivAI?

**CollectivAI** is a personal, but highly ambitious project led by  
**David Miecznikowski** (Field Service Engineer → IT, Cybersecurity & AI Infrastructure).

The core idea:

> Build **real, practical AI infrastructure** that respects  
> **privacy, reliability and human control** – starting from a concrete lab setup,  
> not from a PowerPoint deck.

Instead of yet another „AI hype“ product, CollectivAI focuses on:

- **Infrastructure & routing** (e.g. CollectivAI Router: Gemini / GPT / Ollama / Custom)  
- **Local & privacy-friendly AI** (on macOS M2 Max + Linux lab)  
- **Security & reliability** (inspired by semiconductor & production environments)  
- **European, democratic mindset** instead of pure data extraction

---

## 🧩 Who is behind CollectivAI?

I’m **David Miecznikowski**, 41, with **20+ years of industrial experience**:

- mechanical engineering & special-purpose machinery  
- maintenance & field service in semiconductor fabs  
- on-site work for **Krones**, **Infineon**, **Bosch**  
- 24/7 on-call duty in production-critical environments

I am now transitioning into:

- **IT, cybersecurity and AI-driven infrastructure**,  
- running a self-built lab with  
  - macOS M2 Max as central workstation  
  - multiple Linux VMs (Kali, Parrot, Ubuntu via UTM)  
  - WiFi & network lab (WiFi Pineapple, adapters, 4G/5G dongles)  
  - local AI models and security scripts.

## 🚀 Vision & Direction

CollectivAI is not meant to be „just my hobby project“.  
The long-term direction:

1. **CollectivAI Router**  
   - Route prompts through the *best* backend (Gemini, GPT, local Ollama, custom models)  
   - Apply **ethical & privacy filters** before sending anything out  
   - Provide **transparent routing logic** (no black box)

2. **Local / Hybrid AI Infrastructure**  
   - Strong focus on **on-device** or **self-hosted** AI where possible  
   - Encryption, privacy and **user control over data**  
   - Integration with real-world systems (macOS, Linux, nodes, security tools)

3. **European / Democratic AI Perspective**  
   - Explore models for **democratic participation**,  
   - civic tools, transparent governance,  
   - and alignment with EU values (privacy, dignity, rights).

## 📌 What support is used for?

Support (sponsorship, grants, investment) would be used in a very **concrete and transparent** way, such as:

- 🖥 **Hardware & infrastructure**
  - additional compute for local AI (e.g. GPU nodes, embedded devices)
  - storage & backup for models, logs and documentation
  - dedicated lab hardware for security/network simulations

- 🧪 **Development time**
  - working on the **CollectivAI Router** (routing logic, ethics layer, UI)
  - building **open scripts & tools** for security, monitoring and AI operations
  - documentation (English/German) so others can use and audit the work

- 🛡 **Security, ethics, compliance**
  - time & resources to implement **privacy-by-design** patterns  
  - independent reviews, tests and open discussions around risks and governance

- 📖 **Open documentation & education**
  - guides on how to build **privacy-friendly AI labs** at home or in institutions  
  - examples for schools, civic organisations, small companies

## 🎯 Why support CollectivAI?

- **Real-world background**  
  I come from **semiconductor & production**, not just from theory.  
  I’ve worked in environments where **downtime costs real money** and  
  reliability matters more than hype.

- **Lab-first mentality**  
  Everything starts in a **real lab**, with actual scripts, configs and hardware.  
  You can see the progress in the repositories – not only in slides.

- **European perspective**  
  The project is built with a strong focus on:
  - European values  
  - privacy & dignity  
  - democratic access to AI tools

- **Open, transparent and human**  
  The goal is to publish as much as possible as **open source** and  
  to document decisions in a way that people can understand and question.

## 🛠 Current Public Repositories

- **Founder portfolio (EN/DE):**  
  https://github.com/collectiv-ai/about-founder  

- **Security & system scripts (lab use):** *(planned / in progress)*  
  `security-scripts` – macOS & Linux system/security checks, network quickchecks  

- **CollectivAI Router / App:** *(prototyping phase)*  
  concept for a macOS-style interface that routes AI requests through  
  the best backend with an ethics & privacy layer.

More repositories will be added gradually as the project evolves.

## 🤝 How you can support

There are several ways to support CollectivAI:

- ⭐ **Star & share** the repositories  
- 🐙 **Contribute** (code, documentation, issues, ideas)  
- 💶 **Sponsor** recurring work (GitHub Sponsors / direct support)  
- 🧩 **Partner** for pilot projects (education, civic tech, infrastructure, security labs)

If you are an **institution, foundation, public body or investor** and see  
potential in this direction, I am open to:

- small grants to stabilise the lab & development time  
- pilot projects around **democratic AI / civic AI**  
- collaboration on **European AI infrastructure** concepts.
