# CollectiVAI – Funding & Partnerships Overview

> Public, non-confidential summary for potential funders, partners and sponsors.

## 1. Project Summary

**Project:** CollectiVAI – Democratic AI for Europe  
**Type:** Public-interest AI infrastructure, civic-tech, digital innovation  
**Web:** https://collectivai.org  
**GitHub:** https://github.com/collectiv-ai  

CollectiVAI is a human-centred AI infrastructure project that aims to build a  
*“Sovereign Public AI Network for Europe”* – a democratic, transparent and  
privacy-respecting AI layer that supports citizens, institutions and researchers.

Instead of becoming just another single AI app, CollectivAI connects multiple AI  
models and providers (cloud and local) through one interface and a shared  
ethics & privacy layer. The long-term goal is to provide a trustworthy AI  
“utility layer” for Europe, aligned with democratic values and human rights.

## 2. Societal Relevance & Impact

CollectiVAI focuses on areas with high public value:

- **Democracy & civic participation**  
  Decision support, policy analysis, accessible information and tools  
  that help citizens, journalists and civil society organisations.

- **Science, research & education**  
  AI-assisted research workflows, literature analysis, prototyping and  
  support for universities and research labs.

- **Public administrations & public services**  
  Safe, explainable and auditable AI tools for administrations,  
  aligned with privacy, transparency and accountability requirements.

- **Climate, environment & resilience**  
  Analytical support for climate, sustainability and resilience-related topics,  
  based on open data and transparent models.

The project explicitly avoids speculative token models and focuses on  
long-term public digital infrastructure instead.
